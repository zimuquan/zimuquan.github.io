                I have to admit that I'd kind of forgotten about the so-called Misery Index, a crude measure of the economy that simply adds up the unemployment rate and CPI. The higher it is, the more miserable; the lower the better. But some new work from the Bloomberg Economics team on its trajectory and its impact on politics reminded me to check it out again.<br><BR>

I first recall really hearing about the measure during the Great Financial Crisis and its aftermath, and part of the problem is it didn't really "work" in capturing the misery. That's because CPI plunged so much in 2009 that it brought the index down, even as the economy was obviously in collapse mode.<br><BR>
